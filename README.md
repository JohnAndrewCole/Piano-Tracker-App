Android-only ease of tracking piano self-education

This is a simple, no-frills application, built natively for Android using Kotlin.

My intention is to have an application that can help me:

- Plan out a lesson (what scales, pieces, etc. I will do and for how long)
- Keep track of time during my practice session
- View my historical stats, giving me a clearer view of my progress over long periods of time
