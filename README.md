# Piano Tracker App
Android-only ease of tracking piano self-education

This is a simple, no-frills application, built natively for Android using Kotlin.

My intention is to have an application that can help me:

  a.) Plan out a lesson (what scales, pieces, etc. I will do and for how long)
  b.) Keep track of time during my practice session
  c.) View my historical stats, giving me a clearer view of my progress over long periods of time
  
In future, I will add:

  a.) The ability to add notes
  b.) Upload the stats to a remote database
  c.) Enhanced functionality, such as ear training and a metronome
